# Source control and commit conventions

Use this skill whenever organizing changes into commits, writing or revising
commit messages, rebasing or amending history, or synchronizing a branch in
`joshlf/anneal`.

This skill supplies Anneal's repository-specific commit structure, message
formatting, issue-linking, and [GHerrit](https://github.com/joshlf/gherrit)
stack rules. Combine it with:

- [`commit-message`](../commit-message/SKILL.md) for commit-message content
  and change-vs.-parent accuracy;
- [`reader-oriented-explanation`](../reader-oriented-explanation/SKILL.md) and
  [`williams-style`](../williams-style/SKILL.md) for explanation selection and
  prose style; and
- [`authorship-disclosure`](../authorship-disclosure/SKILL.md) for Git commit
  trailers and pull-request prose disclosures.

## Structure and size commits for review

Arrange commits so a reviewer can read and verify each step independently:

1. **Separate incidental changes from behavioral changes.** Commit code
   movement, file renames, and formatting adjustments in their own commits
   rather than mixing them with functional or behavioral changes.
2. **Keep each commit focused.** Each commit should perform one logical change,
   such as adding a feature, fixing a bug, or refactoring a component.
3. **Size commits thoughtfully.** Split overly large or multi-part changes into
   logical commits, but avoid fragmenting a change so finely that reviewers
   must hold several commits in working memory to understand how the pieces fit
   together.

## Format commit messages to repository conventions

Commit messages must be concise and self-contained. Explain the rationale and
necessary context in the commit message itself rather than relying on an issue
link to supply the explanation; Git history is more durable than issue-tracker
history. Avoid superfluous details and session narrative.

### Subject line and body layout

Follow these formatting rules:

1. **Subsystem prefix:** When a commit affects a specific subsystem, prefix the
   subject line with `[subsystem]` in square brackets, omitting any `anneal`
   prefix (for example, `[ci] Audit merge commits and simplify check_todo.sh`).
2. **Imperative, capitalized subject:** Write the subject in the imperative
   mood (`Add`, `Support`, `Fix`, `Remove`), capitalize the first word after
   any `[subsystem]` prefix, and do not end the subject line with a period.
3. **50-character subject target:** Keep the subject line within 50 characters
   when practical without truncating identifiers or obscuring the change.
4. **Blank line before the body:** Separate the subject line from the body with
   a blank line. Omit the body when the subject line is genuinely
   self-explanatory (such as fixing a typo).
5. **72-character body wrapping:** Wrap body prose at 72 columns, except for
   long URLs, code blocks, or machine-readable trailers. Use the body to
   explain *what* changed and *why*, not merely *how*.

### Issue references

Include relevant GitHub issue references (`#123`) so GitHub links the commit
and the issue:

- When a commit completely resolves an issue, put `Closes #123`, `Fixes #123`,
  or `Resolves #123` on its own line in the body or footer.
- When a commit advances an issue without resolving it, put
  `Makes progress on #123` on its own line.

### Prohibited references and task markers

Commit messages must never contain references to:

1. **Relative moments in time** (such as "currently", "today", "recently", or
   "soon").
2. **Individuals** (by name or handle, outside standard Git attribution
   trailers).
3. **Hosted code reviews or pull requests** (such as
   `https://github.com/joshlf/anneal/pull/...`). Refer to commits in this
   repository by their SHA-1 hash, and refer to commits in other repositories
   by their public commit URL (for example,
   `https://github.com/google/zerocopy/commit/789b3deb`).
4. **Other ephemeral entities** that may not make sense to arbitrary future
   readers.

<!-- TODO-check-disable -->
Do not include `TODO` markers (or their disable/enable directives) anywhere in
a commit message; `./ci/check_todo.sh` audits commit messages across
`origin/main..HEAD` and rejects them.
<!-- TODO-check-enable -->

## Maintain the GHerrit stack

This repository uses [GHerrit](https://github.com/joshlf/gherrit) to synchronize
a local stack of commits with chained Pull Requests on GitHub.

### Branch setup and hooks

1. Inspect the current branch and stack state before changing history.
2. In a new checkout or worktree, ensure GHerrit's Git hooks (`commit-msg`,
   `post-checkout`, and `pre-push`) are installed (`gherrit install`).
3. Work on a GHerrit-managed branch rather than directly on `main`. By default,
   local branches are configured as private stacks (`gherrit manage --private`),
   which sets loopback remotes (`pushRemote = .`) so `git push` synchronizes PR
   phantom branches and version tags to `origin` without pushing the local
   branch name itself. Use `gherrit manage --public` only when publishing the
   local branch ref is intended.

### Trailers across rebases and amendments

1. **Preserve `gherrit-pr-id`:** Each commit on a managed branch has a
   `gherrit-pr-id: G...` trailer that binds the commit to its Pull Request
   across rebases and amendments. Never remove or alter an existing commit's
   `gherrit-pr-id` when running `git commit --amend` or `git rebase -i`.
2. **Assign new IDs to new commits:** When adding a new commit or splitting a
   commit into a separate logical change, let the `commit-msg` hook generate a
   fresh `gherrit-pr-id` for the new commit.
3. **Maintain authorship disclosure:** Keep the required
   `Agent-authored-by: AI agent acting on <user>'s behalf` trailer (with
   `(content only)` or `(commit message only)` when applicable, per
   [`authorship-disclosure`](../authorship-disclosure/SKILL.md)) in the commit's
   final trailer block alongside `gherrit-pr-id`. Recompute the trailer
   qualifier when amending, rebasing, or squashing.

### Pushing and PR description verification

Push only when authorized. On a managed branch, `git push` invokes GHerrit's
`pre-push` hook, which pushes each commit to its phantom branch (`G...`), tags
the patch version (`refs/tags/gherrit/<id>/v<N>`), creates or updates one Pull
Request per commit, and regenerates PR descriptions from commit messages.

Because PR descriptions are separately presented prose under
[`authorship-disclosure`](../authorship-disclosure/SKILL.md) and GHerrit
regenerates them on push, inspect the resulting PR descriptions on GitHub after
pushing. Ensure the required visible prose notice (such as
`*Authored by an AI agent acting on <user>'s behalf.*`) is present at the top of
the PR body while preserving GHerrit's injected stack navigation table and HTML
metadata comments.
