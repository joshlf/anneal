# Agent instructions for Anneal

Read this file before changing the repository. It is the entry point for agent
and contributor work throughout this tree; read any more specific instructions
in the directory you change as well.

## Project principles

Before designing, modifying, or reviewing repository artifacts, read and
preserve [`PRINCIPLES.md`](PRINCIPLES.md) and
[`THREAT_MODEL.md`](THREAT_MODEL.md), which define Anneal's mission,
correctness promise, threat model, and decision-making principles.

## Standing rules

Apply these rules to all work in this repository:

- **File headers:** New source, script, workflow, and documentation files must
  begin with the repository's Fuchsia copyright and license header (matching
  [`PRINCIPLES.md`](PRINCIPLES.md) or [`ci/check_todo.sh`](ci/check_todo.sh)
  in the appropriate comment syntax for the file type) using the file's
  creation year. Preserve the original creation year when modifying an existing
  file. Files whose syntax requires leading metadata or forbids comments (such
  as JSON files or `SKILL.md` files with leading YAML frontmatter) are exempt.
<!-- TODO-check-disable -->
- **`TODO` markers:** Do not leave `TODO` markers in code, documentation, or
  commit messages unless you intend to block merging;
  [`./ci/check_todo.sh`](ci/check_todo.sh) rejects `TODO` across the working
  tree and all commits in `origin/main..HEAD`. Use `FIXME` for non-blocking
  follow-up work. Any temporary or exempted `TODO` must cite an issue using
  `TODO(#123):`.
<!-- TODO-check-enable -->
- **Prose and comment wrapping:** Wrap prose in code comments and Markdown
  files at 80 columns from the left margin when practical, including any
  comment prefix (`//`, `///`, `//!`, `--`, `/--`, `/-!`). Do not wrap Markdown
  tables, ASCII diagrams, long URLs, code blocks, or trailing inline comments
  when wrapping would impair readability. Indent wrapped bullet continuation
  lines by two spaces, and put a blank line between paragraphs and after section
  headings.
- **Pre-commit validation:** Run `./ci/check_todo.sh` (along with any build or
  test checks applicable to the changed files) before finishing a task or
  committing.

## Required skills

The [`skills/`](skills/README.md) directory contains the skills that govern work
in this repository. Whenever your task involves an activity in the table below,
open and read the full `SKILL.md` for every listed skill (plus any
`references/` files it routes you to) before performing that work. Do not infer
a skill's rules from its name or summary. Skills compose: when more than one
applies, follow all of them.

## Architecture and trust boundary

Anneal verifies Rust programs (including unsafe code) by extracting typed
`Runtime(PostCleanup)` MIR and compiler facts via a thin `rustc_driver` wrapper
and checking per-item `VerificationResult` theorems inside the Lean 4 kernel.

Start with [`PRINCIPLES.md`](PRINCIPLES.md),
[`THREAT_MODEL.md`](THREAT_MODEL.md), [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md),
[`README.md`](README.md), [`docs/design.md`](docs/design.md),
[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md), and
[`docs/trust-model.md`](docs/trust-model.md) for the normative project
principles, threat model and execution-isolation boundary, design contract,
three-stage MIR pipeline, how `trusted/` and `trusted/audit/` enforce the trust
boundary, repository map, and links to the architecture issues
([#1](https://github.com/joshlf/anneal/issues/1),
[#100](https://github.com/joshlf/anneal/issues/100),
[#99](https://github.com/joshlf/anneal/issues/99),
[#103](https://github.com/joshlf/anneal/issues/103),
[#88](https://github.com/joshlf/anneal/issues/88),
[#101](https://github.com/joshlf/anneal/issues/101), and
[#102](https://github.com/joshlf/anneal/issues/102)).

Before placing or modifying code, check whether it belongs inside
[`trusted/`](trusted/README.md) or outside it (`theory/`, `crates/`,
`examples/`, `tests/`):

- Only definitions required to state or gate `VerificationResult` (`trusted/lean/`),
  inspect compiled `.olean` environments and manifests (`trusted/audit/`), or
  serialize `rustc` MIR and attributes (`trusted/rustc-capture/`) belong in
  `trusted/`.
- All derived definitions, program transformations (`VerifierPass`, `ExactPass`),
  certificate checkers (`VerifiedChecker`), program logics (`WP`), tactics, and
  CLI orchestration belong outside `trusted/`.

When reviewing code or auditing changes before committing, run a dedicated
[`trust-review`](skills/trust-review/SKILL.md) pass both to verify that code
outside `trusted/`, `ci/`, and `.github/` cannot bypass trust auditing and to
audit any changes inside `trusted/`, `ci/`, `.github/`, or pinned root
manifests.

## Required writing skills

Use the skills from `joshlf/skills` identified in
[the writing policy](agent_docs/writing.md). Read their full instructions before
writing or revising the corresponding material:

- All documentation, explanatory code comments, and commit messages must use
  `reader-oriented-explanation` for content and `williams-style` for style.
- Code comments must additionally use `comment_guidelines`.
- Git commits and separately published prose must additionally use
  `authorship_disclosure`.

The writing policy links to pinned sources and explains how these requirements
apply to commits and PR descriptions. A summary of a skill is not a substitute
for reading it.

## Rust correspondence in `trusted/`

Any code in [`trusted/`](trusted/README.md) that claims to model Rust semantics
or extract `rustc` compiler structures must follow
[the Rust correspondence comment policy](agent_docs/trusted-rust.md). Its
comments must explain the correspondence and both quote and cite the applicable
Rust documentation or compiler source at a pinned version.

## Development and validation

Read [the development guide](agent_docs/development.md) before making changes.
It explains how to preserve claim meanings, enforce the `trusted/` containment
boundary, run validation checks, and maintain the GHerrit stack.

## Agentic proof construction workflow

When discharging per-item Lean 4 proof obligations for a Rust crate with
`cargo anneal`, follow [the agent proof construction workflow](docs/agent-proof-workflow.md),
[the agent harness setup guide](docs/agent-harness-setup.md), and
[the project owner guide](docs/project-owner-guide.md), and load the
[`anneal-prove` skill](skills/anneal-prove/SKILL.md) and
[`anneal-lsp` skill](skills/anneal-lsp/SKILL.md). In locked
verification sessions (`cargo anneal lock-specs` followed by
`cargo anneal agent-verify`), only `anneal/proofs/Proof/<Crate>/<Item>.lean` is
writable; specification overrides (`anneal/proofs/Specs/**`), assumption modules
(`anneal/proofs/Assumptions/**`), and generated assembly (`.anneal/**`) are
locked and audited.

## Commenting in `trusted/`

Because auditing `trusted/` and its explicit, pinned dependency manifest must
suffice to verify that Anneal upholds [`PRINCIPLES.md`](PRINCIPLES.md), all code
in `trusted/` will undergo careful human review. Human understanding is
therefore paramount in `trusted/`: comment liberally using
[`comment-guidelines`](skills/comment-guidelines/SKILL.md) (and its companion
writing skills in the table above) so a human auditor can verify the design
rationale, invariants, assumptions, contracts, and subtle semantic or
implementation choices without reconstructing unstated context. Include Lean
comment markers (`--`, `/--`, `/-!`) alongside Rust comment markers (`//`,
`///`, `//!`).

## Dependencies in `trusted/`

When implementing or modifying components in `trusted/`:

- **Do not hand-roll standard utilities:** Do not write bespoke argument
  parsers, serializers, cryptographic hashers, or logging machinery to avoid
  adding a dependency. Rely on battle-tested, standard ecosystem crates.
- **Audit economy:** A concise, idiomatic interface built on a standard crate
  is much easier for human reviewers to audit than hundreds of lines of
  hand-rolled plumbing.
- **Dependency discipline:** Keep dependencies in `trusted/` focused and
  conservative. Prefer crates with minimal transitive dependencies and generic,
  well-understood failure modes that do not pose soundness risks specific to
  Anneal.

## Technical reference corpus

The orphan [`reference`](https://github.com/google/zerocopy/tree/reference)
branch of `google/zerocopy` (`refs/heads/reference` in a local `zerocopy`
checkout or worktree, or fetched from `https://github.com/google/zerocopy.git`)
maintains a general-purpose technical reference corpus (`CATALOG.json` and
`reports/<package>/`) covering topics such as Rust operational semantics,
`rustc` MIR stages and internals, Lean 4 kernel and elaboration behavior,
Charon, Aeneas, and Anneal's verification architecture.

- **Consulting existing research:** When designing architecture, modeling
  semantics, or investigating non-obvious system, compiler, or kernel behavior,
  check the `reference` branch (when accessible in your environment) and follow
  its [`AGENTS.md`](https://github.com/google/zerocopy/blob/reference/AGENTS.md)
  before repeating broad source crawls or experiments from scratch:
  - Filter `CATALOG.json` programmatically (rather than reading the full file
    into context) to find relevant packages under `reports/<package>/`.
  - Check each report's subject revisions (`REPORT.json`), `Applicability`, and
    `Boundaries` against the versions Anneal pins. Primary upstream sources
    retain authority and must still be quoted and cited directly in `trusted/`
    comments.
- **Running new `reference-research` (human approval required):** When a design
  or soundness decision depends on non-obvious technical behavior that is not
  in `CATALOG.json` and cannot be resolved by a quick local check—or after an
  engineering task uncovers expensive-to-recover findings worth preserving—
  consider [`skills/reference-research/SKILL.md`](https://github.com/google/zerocopy/blob/reference/skills/reference-research/SKILL.md)
  on `google/zerocopy`'s `reference` branch. Do not launch `reference-research`
  or push to `google/zerocopy` without explicit user approval: state the
  concrete question(s) or findings to harvest and ask the user whether to run
  `reference-research` (and whether to stop after **brainstorm / plan only** or
  run **end-to-end execution and publication**).
