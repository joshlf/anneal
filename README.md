# Anneal

Anneal is a verification framework for Rust under active development. See
[`PRINCIPLES.md`](PRINCIPLES.md) for the project principles,
[`THREAT_MODEL.md`](THREAT_MODEL.md) for the threat model, and
[`META_PRINCIPLES.md`](META_PRINCIPLES.md) for the invariant goals that govern
them.

See the [experimental scalar verifier guide](docs/mvp.md) for installation,
configured verification requests, supported scope and the Starnix proof fixture.

## Correctness policy and `trusted/`

[`PRINCIPLES.md`](PRINCIPLES.md) promises that if the code in a verification
result's TCB audit log is correct, its assumptions are valid, and Anneal emits
no errors, then the verified code is sound and satisfies any stated
specifications. A **verification result** asserts that:

1. its **TCB** satisfies its **trust policy**, and
2. if the trusted code in its **TCB** is correct, and its trusted assumptions
   are jointly valid, then its requested **claim** (baseline soundness and any
   stated specifications) holds.

The `trusted/` directory isolates every first-party component of Anneal on
which those two assertions depend without checked evidence. The invariant of
`trusted/` is that **auditing `trusted/` and its explicit, pinned dependency
manifest is sufficient to verify that Anneal upholds
[`META_PRINCIPLES.md`](META_PRINCIPLES.md), [`PRINCIPLES.md`](PRINCIPLES.md),
and [`THREAT_MODEL.md`](THREAT_MODEL.md)**: an auditor never needs to inspect
first-party code outside `trusted/` to trust a verification result. This must
remain true in the face of adversarial implementations in any other part of the
repository.

To keep the human audit surface tractable and reliable, `trusted/` permits
battle-tested, widely-used external libraries for routine utilities (such as
command-line flag parsing, serialization, and trace logging). Using established
libraries for generic infrastructure is strongly preferred over hand-rolling
bespoke implementations inside `trusted/`, which inflates audit burden and
invites defect-prone reinvented wheels.

(Currently, `.github` is an exception to this rule, although we aim to tighten
that as well.)

## Design documentation

- [`META_PRINCIPLES.md`](META_PRINCIPLES.md): The invariant goals governing
  [`PRINCIPLES.md`](PRINCIPLES.md) and [`THREAT_MODEL.md`](THREAT_MODEL.md)—the
  end-to-end sufficiency of bounded human review, the prohibition on security
  theater, and the hierarchy of governing documents.
- [`PRINCIPLES.md`](PRINCIPLES.md): Anneal's mission, correctness promise, and
  decision-making priority order.
- [`THREAT_MODEL.md`](THREAT_MODEL.md): Threat model, the division of labor
  between bounded human review (stated specifications and the TCB audit log)
  and automated verification, and the explicit assumptions and in-scope threats
  Anneal defends against.
- [`docs/design.md`](docs/design.md): Overall system design, end-to-end
  verification workflow, library-centric verification, multi-modal
  specifications, and incremental adoption.
- [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md): The three-stage MIR pipeline,
  repository layout, `rustc` extraction lifecycle, and multi-version toolchain
  strategy.
- [`docs/trust-model.md`](docs/trust-model.md): How Anneal's internal `trusted/`
  vs. `theory/` boundary and `trusted/audit/` implement and enforce
  [`META_PRINCIPLES.md`](META_PRINCIPLES.md), [`PRINCIPLES.md`](PRINCIPLES.md),
  and [`THREAT_MODEL.md`](THREAT_MODEL.md).

## Repository checks

See [the scaffold contributor guide](docs/scaffolding.md) to build and install
the current toolchain archive, run workspace and installed-tool tests, and check
crate packaging.

See [the Codex review gate guide](docs/codex-review.md) for enabling the required
review status, diagnosing blocked PRs, and testing the evaluator locally.
